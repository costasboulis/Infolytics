The recsServer has two functions

A) To upload new models to the Amazon SimpleDB domain
B) Serve recommendations

To upload new models, you need to upload 2 files in S3 under bucket sintagespareas. The one is the correlations file
and the other the metadata file. Once these two files are placed you open a cygwin shell and do

'curl -d "correlations=sintagesPareasCorrelations_top10.csv&metadata=rr_recipes.csv" http://recs-sintagespareas.elasticbeanstalk.com/recs/items/create  -v'

To install curl under cygwin look under Web category during the installation process

If you want to do a GET and return JSON
'curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://recs-sintagespareas.elasticbeanstalk.com/recs/items/10997'

OR for JSONP

'curl -H "Accept: application/x-javascript" http://recs-sintagespareas.elasticbeanstalk.com/recs/items/10997?jsoncallback=jsoncallback'
